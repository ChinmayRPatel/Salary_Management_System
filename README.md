## Executive Summary

Salary Management System is a tool used to maintain records of all the users working in an organization, providing an easy GUI for the Admin. This system is per organization. At the front end of the system, we have used Spring Tool Suite / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse IDE in JAVA technology and Spring Inbuilt server for maintaining databases. The project proceeds through a sequence of well-designed JSP pages with validation to security, consistency, reliability, etc. Various users are provided which can perform various operations and tasks for which they have been authorized respectively. Basically, there are 2 types of users: Employee and Admin. Admin is fully authorized, while other users are authorized up to a certain level. Based on user authorization, users can perform various operations like adding information of a new employee, updating information, viewing the list of employees, generating pay slips of particular employees, and generating reports of the organization. This system is very user-friendly and easily maintains all the information for all kinds of users without any difficulties. The system also generates fault and error messages in case of invalid operations or if the user enters invalid or wrong information for some particular cases.

## Problem Statement

The purpose of making this web application is to create a portal for start-ups and various companies to provide their employees a payroll that shows their monthly income including incentives, bonuses, and taxes respectively. Generating a payroll helps the company keep records of the salary given to all the employees in their organization. Having access to this information can improve employee satisfaction, while also saving human resources professionals' time.

## Description

Payroll Management System is a system that maintains all the records of all employees of an organization. This system is developed to ease the process of searching and maintaining the valuable records of all types of users (i.e., employees). Payroll Management System is easy to understand, easy to use, and offers the simplicity of managing various records of an organization. This powerful software program is specifically designed for maintaining overall information of an organization. This intuitive visual interface makes various aspects of performing various operations related to all kinds of users. PMS controls all back-end functionalities like generating pay slips.

## Findings

The prime focus for many start-ups, at the very initial stage, is “Revenue Growth and reduction in Unnecessary Cost." A tight control on these two important areas would take them a long way in this swiftly changing business world. Many companies track attendance, working hours, overtime, assigned tasks and projects, task deadlines, salary calculation, PF, ESIC, LWF, PT, and all these calculations manually, which is obviously prone to human errors and provides little defense against legal issues. In the era of automation where most business processes are digitized, technology can have a significant impact at key stages of the employee life cycle. At HR Gird, we identify that improving these basic HR processes will take an organization to the next level and would inculcate a positive experience for potential as well as existing employees, improving employee engagement in the long run. Understanding and accepting that every organization's need is different, we provide customized solutions (Online + On Premises) as per the organization's need.

## Implementation

Basic implementation of the employee payroll management system has been done in which the admin maintains all the records of all employees of an organization. The Admin will first register all the employees under the organization. The Admin has the privilege to update and manage the users' data stored under the database. The Admin is a user who manages information about all the employees as well as generating pay slips. The Admin will enter the employee details to generate the payslip and can send it via mail to the employee’s email. The Admin can also print the payroll of the employee and send it to the employee respectively.

## Discussion

1. Enter Details of All Employees.
2. Select the Employee for whom you want to generate Payroll.
3. When Payroll is generated, select either to print or send it via email (you can do both).
4. Logout.

## Input Study

1. Validation is done at the user end.
2. Session handling is properly done in the database.

## Conclusion

We have implemented a project by understanding all the modules of this project. We have checked the feasibility and the requirements of the system. Then we designed the GUI and the flow control roughly on paper. After this, the actual implementation of our modules was started. Initially, all the modules were developed separately and later all were integrated with each other. The next phase we came across was testing. We tested each module individually and later the whole system. Thus, through this system, an organization can easily maintain records of all the users efficiently and can perform various operations easily. We experienced an enhancement in our designing and technical skills of programming through the development of this software.
